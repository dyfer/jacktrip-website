          <h3 class="separator dark-text-title mainHead">Why is Latency Important?</h3>
          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns">The Internet is widely used for audio communications. Numerous
            collaboration
            applications exist that make it trivial to carry on a conversation with almost anyone, worldwide. Likely,
            you already use these applications regularly. What is thought of as traditional phone lines have even
            largely migrated towards running over the Internet. So, why is performing music any different?</p>

          <div class="pic_env float_r seven columns" reset-margin-padding><img src="images/band.jpg" alt="Image of a band playing inside together."></div>

                    <p class="pic_env dark-text font-400 five columns">The answer lies in the problem of trying to keep a common rhythm together. Maintaining a shared beat or sense of pulse is difficult if it takes too long for one musician's sound to reach another's ears. There can be drastic consequences. The "Happy Birthday" effect is familiar from video conference apps. The length of time for sound to get around the group makes it impossible for the group to sing together. Individuals find themselves in a situation of "I'm waiting for you and you're waiting for me" and that's the problem. Video calls are engineered for talking and turn taking. Music is different because it involves simultaneous coordinated activity rather than alternation. Tightly synchronized performance only works over the Internet with specially-adapted applications like JackTrip.</p>


          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns">
          A group’s ability to maintain a steady pulse is heavily impacted by what is known as latency. This is a term which refers to how long it takes for one performer's sound to reach the ears of another. It is typically measured in milliseconds, or 1/1000 of a second. Research has found that the ability to perform syncronized rhythms together requires a latency below 25-30 milliseconds. There isn’t a hard and fast number for this because everyone is different and musical situations are different. Particularly important in this regard is the speed or tempo of a piece (measured in beats per minute). Slower tempi can tolerate relatively longer latencies.  </p>

          <div class="pic_env float_l lp six columns"><img src="images/graphic_25ft_25ms.png" alt="Graphic representing how fast sound travels."></div>

          <p class="pic_env dark-text font-400 float_r lp six columns">To help put this into perspective, sound traveling 25
            feet (roughly 8 meters) through air takes about 25
            milliseconds. We're comfortable playing or singing together at distances around this range. As a group spreads out, say across a football field, its ability to maintain a coordinate rhythm becomes increasingly
            difficult.
            This is why minimizing latency is so important.</p>

            Internet, the sound you make has to
            pass through several stages to reach another performer. Each of these stages adds latency.
            We’ve color-coded these to help illustrate the relative speed of each stage, with slow being orange and the
            slowest red. The Internet backbone stage is blue because it is special.</p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400">Geography has the largest impact on the latency of the Internet backbone.
            Typically,
            the farther away one performer is from another, the longer it will take the sound to reach them. This is
            limited
            not just by the speed of light, but also how many different backbone networks (or “network hops”) it has to
            pass
            through. This limitation means you are likely unable to experience low latency with anyone that is
            physically
            located more than a few hundred miles away from you. But the Internet backbone is usually very fast
            (a few milliseconds) if your physical distance from other performers is less than a few hundred miles.</p>

            fiber-to-the-home
            (FTTH) being fastest (about 2 milliseconds) and cable being one of the slowest (about 10-15 milliseconds).
            Note that latency is very different from the bandwidth of your Internet connection, which is how much data
            it is
            able to transmit over a given period of time. Having a high bandwidth rate (even gigabit) often does not
            correspond
            to having low latency. Given that the Internet connection to your home is not easy to change, and the
            availability
            of low latency connections is relatively poor, we will focus on optimizing latency for the other stages.</p>

          referred
          to as your “sound card.” Every sound card is different and our testing of various devices indicates a very
          large range.
          Laptops can easily have latency over 100 milliseconds, and even the best USB hardware has latency in the range
          of 5-15 milliseconds.
          Low latency is often not a high priority for sound card manufacturers, because the most common use cases like
          playing back recorded
          music, music video soundtracks, video games, and conversations, do not require it.</p>

        <p class="dark-text font-400">The best way to reduce your sound card latency is using a hardware device
          which is specifically
          designed for it. The most economical way we’ve found to do this is using our JackTrip Device, which includes a
          Raspberry Pi computer
          bundled with HiFiBerry sound card. It provides very high-quality audio at a low price, while also enabling you
          to reduce this latency
          to about 1 millisecond.</p>

            handle
            more than about five performers. This model is not viable for larger groups.

            performer’s
            computer sends a single copy of their audio input to a central server. The server mixes all the audio
            streams together
            and sends a single copy of the mix back to every performer’s computer, which plays it to their audio output.
            You can visualize this model as a hub and spoke pattern:

            for each performer in the client-server model remain constantly low, regardless of the number of performers.
            However, this is not completely free. The server’s processing and bandwidth requirements still grow
            proportionally
            with the number of performers. The key difference is that servers are designed for this, and can easily be
            scaled to
            handle up to handle hundreds of performers. This makes the client-server model most suitable for use with
            groups
            that are larger than a handful of performers.

          <h3 class="separator dark-text-title mainHead">Why JackTrip?</h3>
          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            The mission of JackTrip is to make performing music over the Internet as easy and accessible as possible. 
            Most companies you may be familiar with use a peer-to-peer based technology. They are designed to help you jam 
            with a buddy, or at best connect with a few other bandmates. Instead, we are using client-server technology to 
            facilitate both small and large groups.
          </p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            Configuring and managing your own central server can be hard. Some applications make it easy to run a server on 
            your own computer, but this can increase everyone’s latency significantly. Your home Internet connection is always 
            one of the slowest stages, and running your own server requires that everyone’s sound traverses it not once, but 
            twice, usually adding over 10 milliseconds of latency. Few people also have server-class hardware in their homes, 
            or the upstream bandwidth required to handle more than a few performers.
          </p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            Our servers are located in an optimal location on the Internet backbone. They include sufficient bandwidth and
            processing power to handle up to hundreds of performers. Provided that you live within one of our supported 
            geographical locations, the additional latency of using a JackTrip server compared to P2P will be insignificant.
          </p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            Our web application does all the work of managing servers for you. You can easily pause servers when you are not 
            using them, and you only have to pay for the resources they consume while they are running.

          </p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            You can use the popular, open-source JackTrip and Jamulus clients directly with JackTrip servers. For the best 
            possible experience, we offer free disk images for Raspberry Pi that supports both USB and popular HAT sound devices. 
            Users of these images can also use our web application to fully manage their devices. You never need to use a Unix 
            command line, or even plug in a keyboard or monitor. We also offer fully assembled devices for the ultimate 
            plug-and-play experience.

          <h3 class="separator dark-text-title mainHead">Why Not JackTrip?</h3>
          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            JackTrip is not ideal for everyone. The additional latency of using our servers can become a barrier if all performers 
            do not reside within one of our supported geographical areas. If this is you, please keep checking back with us. 
            We intend to expand these over time.
          </p>

          <p class="dark-text font-400 twelve columns" style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            If you are able to make firewall changes, and just want to jam with a few other performers, one of the available P2P 
            applications may be a viable alternative. We recommend trying out JamKazam, SoundJack and the Raspberry Jam project.
